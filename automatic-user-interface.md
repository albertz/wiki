# Idea

* Write code for logic of some application.
* User interface (GUI) automatically derived, e.g. from classes.
   * Attributes are shown.
   * Methods become clickable buttons.

## Some problems

* Not all attributes, objects, classes, methods should maybe be shown.
* How to show them? Many different ways, e.g. just the order/organization on screen.

## Some solutions

* Add extra information:
   * What should be visible to the user
   * How to show it
   * Where to show it
