* Specific technical questions where there is likely a clear answer
-> [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or any of the other [StackExchange sites](https://stackexchange.com/)

* Any random short question -> [Quora](https://quora.com/)

* Question with more open follow-up discussion
   * Maybe discussion-oriented subreddits?
