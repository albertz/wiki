# Backup software

## My use case

### What I want to backup

There are overlaps between these points.
Also, temporary files might/should be excluded (e.g. `/tmp/*`).

* full Linux system including all files, such that recovering that will give me a fully functional system
* home directories
* archives (which are themselves backups of older computers/discs, where I don't have direct access to anymore)
* projects (programming but also other things)
* my pictures
* my music collection
* maybe movies (not so important)
* contact details (e.g. Google contacts)
* Tweets
* movie rankings (score11.de, imdb)
* documents / texts


### Backup properties

* certain files are more important than others (e.g. home directory files are quite important, programming projects, mails)
* I want to keep several copies around. Not all copy must be complete, they could maybe just have the important files.
* Some overview where I have what backup, and which files are there, and maybe even the version of them, would be useful.
