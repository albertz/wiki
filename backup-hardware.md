# Backup hardware

This complements with [backup software](backup-software.md).

For your backups
(and also any data in general,
 but see [backup software discussion about the type of data](backup-software.md))
you want to have some appropriate hardware.

That can include offline media, like tapes, DVDs etc
(or even hard drives which you archive).

Or it can be online / live, and then usually accessible via network in some way.
This is then called a [Network-attached storage (NAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) system
-- or at least, a NAS is very related.


## NAS

Never use hardware RAID but always software RAID.
ZFS scrub.
