# Personal knowledge base

A personal knowledge base is a knowledge base which organizes all your personal knowledge.
A knowledge base is like a database. E.g. it could be a Wiki. Or text files.

A personal knowledge base can really cover everything, like fact knowledge what you learned in school / university / research.
It could also be random ideas / thoughts.

You can extend on that, and it could also contain written documents, code, and other media such as pictures.
At some point, part of it should maybe be public, while most of it should be private, so it needs an access-control list.
In any case, being able to hyperlink between items is important.

It might make sense to have certain parts organized in separate software
(e.g. some picture management tool, some backup software, ...)
but the distinction can become blury at the edges, and makes hyperlinking harder,
and ultimatively will probably make the organization worse.

This document is mostly about how to organize that. Such as via a Wiki software.
