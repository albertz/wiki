# Personal knowledge base

A personal knowledge base is a knowledge base which organizes all your personal knowledge.
A knowledge base is like a database. E.g. it could be a Wiki. Or text files.

A personal knowledge base can really cover everything, like fact knowledge what you learned in school / university / research.
It could also be random ideas / thoughts.

You can extend on that, and it could also contain written documents, code, and other media such as pictures.
At some point, part of it should maybe be public, while most of it should be private, so it needs an access-control list.
In any case, being able to hyperlink between items is important.

It might make sense to have certain parts organized in separate software
(e.g. some picture management tool, some backup software, ...)
but the distinction can become blury at the edges, and makes hyperlinking harder,
and ultimatively will probably make the organization worse.

This document is mostly about how to organize that. Such as via a Wiki software.

Some of these solutions only cover some parts of what would make a useful personal knowledge base.

* This wiki here. (Mostly useful for public text.)
* I keep lots of knowledge in my `~/Documents` directory.
  This directory consists mostly of txt files.
  It is versioned under Git, and kept in sync accross many computers.
  Basically this is all the private part of my personal knowledge base.
  Once I want to make sth public, I could move it to this wiki.
* Backup software ([this wiki entry](backup-software.md), [other project](https://github.com/albertz/backup_system))
  (For any kind of media.)
* Zettelk√§sten ([HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21208196), [blog](https://clerestory.netlify.com/zk/))
* [Error DB](https://github.com/albertz/errordb) (Only for collected error messages.)
* [Personal assistent](https://github.com/albertz/personal_assistant)
  (A software to organize the knowledge base, and also to make it more useful by giving you context relevant information.)
